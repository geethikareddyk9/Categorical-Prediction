# Categorical-Prediction

This project aims to build a machine learning model that is given with a data set of continuous and categorical data to predict the continuous target value. The data is preprocessed and removed null values. The categorical data is converted to continous data using label encoder. Data is divided into test and train data. Linear Regression and Random forest are used to train the model. Random Forest algorithm has more accuracy than linear regression ie, less RMSE(Root Mean Square Error) value - 0.38 .
